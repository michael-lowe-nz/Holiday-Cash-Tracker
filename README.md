# Holiday-Cash-Tracker
A simple app that helps you to easily keep track of spending while you are on holiday

This app initially will use React and Redux on the Client, Express as a backend framework, and MongoDB as the DB.

I am mainly making this app as a way to teach myself how to setup a MongoDB and create the API that interacts with it in node.

Will look to use different technologies once it is up and running as I want this to work for the trip that I am currently on and these are the technologies that I am most comfortable with (with the exception of MongoDB)
